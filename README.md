# streamlit-firstlanguage: Streamlit Components to access FirstLanguage NLP API


This package provides interactive Streamlit components to access FirstLanguage NLP API. For full FirstLanguage API documentation, please visit our site [FirstLanguage API](https://firstlanguage.in)

For direct SDK options, please visit:

[Python SDK](https://github.com/FirstLanguage/firstlanguage_python)

[TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/FirstLanguage/firstlanguage-typescript)

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

You can install streamlit-firstlanguage from PyPi using pip:
```bash
pip install streamlit-firstlanguage
```

You will need API Key to access our API. Please register with us to get your life-time FREE API Key. Credit Card not required!!!

[Regsitration Page Link](https://www.firstlanguage.in/auth/create-account)


You can then access our API with one line of code.

For example, you can implement a Named Entity Recognition App with below code

```python
#ner.py
import streamlit_firstlanguage as fl

fl.firstlanguage_ner(name="fl_ner",apiKey="<Your_API_Key>")
```

You can then run your app with 
```bash
streamlit run ner.py
```
The app should pop up in your web browser.

Below is a list of NLP Tasks that you can access with our API,



| NLP Task    | Streamlit Component   |
|--------------|------------|
|  Stemmer      |  firstlanguage_stem()        |
|  Lemmatizer     |  firstlanguage_lemma()        |
|  Morphological Analyzer      |  firstlanguage_morph()        |
|  POSTagger      |  firstlanguage_postag()        |
|  Text Classification       |  firstlanguage_classify()        |
|  Question Answering     |  firstlanguage_qa()        |
|  Table Question Answering     |  firstlanguage_tableqa()        |
